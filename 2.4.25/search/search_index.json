Automating API guidelines means you can keep APIs consistent and secure throughout their lifecycle. Even better, you can shape the design of the API before it even exists by combining API linting with a design-first API workflow.</p> <p>Our API linter is designed for speed on even large documents, and it's easy to run locally, in CI, or anywhere you need it. It's also designed for humans, with meaningful error messages to help you get your API right every time.</p> <p>Try it like this:</p> <pre><code>redocly lint openapi.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>Configure the rules as you wish. Other API Linters use complicated identifiers like JSONPath, but Redocly makes life easy with simple expressions that understand the API specification structure.

In other words:</p> <ul> <li>brace expansion is for generating new lists</li> <li>brace matching is for filtering existing lists</li> </ul> More about brace expansion (click to expand)  There are two main types of brace expansion:  1. **lists**: which are defined using comma-separated values inside curly braces: `{a,b,c}` 2. **sequences**: which are defined using a starting value and an ending value, separated by two dots: `a{1..3}b`. Optionally, a third argument may be passed to define a \"step\" or increment to use: `a{1..100..10}b`. These are also sometimes referred to as \"ranges\".  Here are some example brace patterns to illustrate how they work:  **Sets**  <pre><code>{a,b,c}       =&gt; a b c\n{a,b,c}{1,2}  =&gt; a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2\n</code></pre>  **Sequences**  <pre><code>{1..9}        =&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n{4..-4}       =&gt; 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4\n{1..20..3}    =&gt; 1 4 7 10 13 16 19\n{a..j}        =&gt; a b c d e f g h i j\n{j..a}        =&gt; j i h g f e d c b a\n{a..z..3}     =&gt; a d g j m p s v y\n</code></pre>  **Combination**  Sets and sequences can be mixed together or used along with any other strings.  <pre><code>{a,b,c}{1..3}   =&gt; a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3\nfoo/{a,b,c}/bar =&gt; foo/a/bar foo/b/bar foo/c/bar\n</code></pre>  The fact that braces can be \"expanded\" from relatively simple patterns makes them ideal for quickly generating test fixtures, file paths, and similar use cases.  ## Brace matching  In addition to _expansion_, brace patterns are also useful for performing regular-expression-like matching.  For example, the pattern `foo/{1..3}/bar` would match any of following strings:  <pre><code>foo/1/bar\nfoo/2/bar\nfoo/3/bar\n</code></pre>  But not:  <pre><code>baz/1/qux\nbaz/2/qux\nbaz/3/qux\n</code></pre>  Braces can also be combined with [glob patterns](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) to perform more advanced wildcard matching. For example, the pattern `*/{1..3}/*` would match any of following strings:  <pre><code>foo/1/bar\nfoo/2/bar\nfoo/3/bar\nbaz/1/qux\nbaz/2/qux\nbaz/3/qux\n</code></pre>  ## Brace matching pitfalls  Although brace patterns offer a user-friendly way of matching ranges or sets of strings, there are also some major disadvantages and potential risks you should be aware of.  ### tldr  **\"brace bombs\"**  - brace expansion can eat up a huge amount of processing resources - as brace patterns increase _linearly in size_, the system resources required to expand the pattern increase exponentially - users can accidentally (or intentially) exhaust your system's resources resulting in the equivalent of a DoS attack (bonus: no programming knowledge is required!)  For a more detailed explanation with examples, see the [geometric complexity](#geometric-complexity) section.  ### The solution  Jump to the [performance section](#performance) to see how Braces solves this problem in comparison to other libraries.  ### Geometric complexity  At minimum, brace patterns with sets limited to two elements have quadradic or `O(n^2)` complexity. But the complexity of the algorithm increases exponentially as the number of sets, _and elements per set_, increases, which is `O(n^c)`.  For example, the following sets demonstrate quadratic (`O(n^2)`) complexity:  <pre><code>{1,2}{3,4}      =&gt; (2X2)    =&gt; 13 14 23 24\n{1,2}{3,4}{5,6} =&gt; (2X2X2)  =&gt; 135 136 145 146 235 236 245 246\n</code></pre>  But add an element to a set, and we get a n-fold Cartesian product with `O(n^c)` complexity:  <pre><code>{1,2,3}{4,5,6}{7,8,9} =&gt; (3X3X3) =&gt; 147 148 149 157 158 159 167 168 169 247 248\n                                    249 257 258 259 267 268 269 347 348 349 357\n                                    358 359 367 368 369\n</code></pre>  Now, imagine how this complexity grows given that each element is a n-tuple:  <pre><code>{1..100}{1..100}         =&gt; (100X100)     =&gt; 10,000 elements (38.4 kB)\n{1..100}{1..100}{1..100} =&gt; (100X100X100) =&gt; 1,000,000 elements (5.76 MB)\n</code></pre>  Although these examples are clearly contrived, they demonstrate how brace patterns can quickly grow out of control.  **More information**  Interested in learning more about brace expansion?  - [linuxjournal/bash-brace-expansion](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-brace-expansion) - [rosettacode/Brace_expansion](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Brace_expansion) - [cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product)"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/braces/#performance","title":"Performance","text":"<p>Braces is not only screaming fast, it's also more accurate the other brace expansion libraries.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/braces/#better-algorithms","title":"Better algorithms","text":"<p>Fortunately there is a solution to the \"brace bomb\" problem: don't expand brace patterns into an array when they're used for matching.</p> <p>Instead, convert the pattern into an optimized regular expression.

Because older versions of jsdom are known to be buggy in ways that result in XSS even if DOMPurify does everything 100% correctly. There are known attack vectors in, e.g. jsdom v19.0.0 that are fixed in jsdom v20.0.0 - and we really recommend to keep jsdom up to date because of that.</p> <p>Please also be aware that tools like happy-dom exist but are not considered safe at this point. Combining DOMPurify with happy-dom is currently not recommended and will likely lead to XSS.</p> <p>Other than that, you are fine to use DOMPurify on the server. Probably. This really depends on jsdom or whatever DOM you utilize server-side. If you can live with that, this is how you get it to work:</p> <pre><code>npm install dompurify\nnpm install jsdom\n</code></pre> <p>For jsdom (please use an up-to-date version), this should do the trick:</p> <pre><code>const createDOMPurify = require('dompurify');\nconst { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');\n\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\nconst DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('&lt;b&gt;hello there&lt;/b&gt;');\n</code></pre> <p>Or even this, if you prefer working with imports:</p> <pre><code>import { JSDOM } from 'jsdom';\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\nconst purify = DOMPurify(window);\nconst clean = purify.sanitize('&lt;b&gt;hello there&lt;/b&gt;');\n</code></pre> <p>If you have problems making it work in your specific setup, consider looking at the amazing isomorphic-dompurify project which solves lots of problems people might run into.</p> <pre><code>npm install isomorphic-dompurify\n</code></pre> <pre><code>import DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('&lt;s&gt;hello&lt;/s&gt;');\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/dompurify/#is-there-a-demo","title":"Is there a demo?","text":"<p>Of course there is a demo!

Other than this library, I can personally recommend both globby and fast-glob, though they differ in their benefits and drawbacks.</p> <p>Both have very nice APIs and are reasonably fast.</p> <p><code>fast-glob</code> is, as far as I am aware, the fastest glob implementation in JavaScript today. However, there are many cases where the choices that <code>fast-glob</code> makes in pursuit of speed mean that its results differ from the results returned by Bash and other sh-like shells, which may be surprising.</p> <p>In my testing, <code>fast-glob</code> is around 10-20% faster than this module when walking over 200k files nested 4 directories deep1. However, there are some inconsistencies with Bash matching behavior that this module does not suffer from:</p> <ul> <li><code>**</code> only matches files, not directories</li> <li><code>..</code> path portions are not handled unless they appear at the   start of the pattern</li> <li><code>./!(&lt;pattern&gt;)</code> will not match any files that start with   <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code>, even if they do not match <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code>. For   example, <code>!(9).txt</code> will not match <code>9999.txt</code>.</li> <li>Some brace patterns in the middle of a pattern will result in   failing to find certain matches.</li> <li>Extglob patterns are allowed to contain <code>/</code> characters.</li> </ul> <p>Globby exhibits all of the same pattern semantics as fast-glob, (as it is a wrapper around fast-glob) and is slightly slower than node-glob (by about 10-20% in the benchmark test set, or in other words, anywhere from 20-50% slower than fast-glob). However, it adds some API conveniences that may be worth the costs.</p> <ul> <li>Support for <code>.gitignore</code> and other ignore files.</li> <li>Support for negated globs (ie, patterns starting with <code>!</code>   rather than using a separate <code>ignore</code> option).</li> </ul> <p>The priority of this module is \"correctness\" in the sense of performing a glob pattern expansion as faithfully as possible to the behavior of Bash and other sh-like shells, with as much speed as possible.</p> <p>[!NOTE] Prior versions of <code>node-glob</code> are not on this list. Former versions of this module are far too slow for any cases where performance matters at all, and were designed with APIs that are extremely dated by current JavaScript standards.</p> <p>[1]: In the cases where this module returns results and <code>fast-glob</code> doesn't, it's even faster, of course.</p>

In general templates will either reduce the number of <code>../</code> instances or leave them as is. See #1028.</li> <li>The <code>=</code> character is now HTML escaped. This closes a potential exploit case when using unquoted attributes, i.e. <code>&lt;div foo={{bar}}&gt;</code>. In general it's recommended that attributes always be quoted when their values are generated from a mustache to avoid any potential exploit surfaces.</li> <li>AST constructors have been dropped in favor of plain old javascript objects</li> <li>The runtime version has been increased.

How come? Because humans can look at the whole code to put the <code>/</code> characters in context. A JavaScript regex cannot. It only sees forwards. (Well, ES2018 regexes can also look backwards. See the ES2018 section).</p> <p>When the <code>jsTokens</code> regex scans throught the above, it will see the following at the end of both the <code>number</code> and <code>regex</code> rows:</p> <pre><code>/ 2/g\n</code></pre> <p>It is then impossible to know if that is a regex literal, or part of an expression dealing with division.</p> <p>Here is a similar case:</p> <pre><code>foo /= 2/g\nfoo(/= 2/g)\n</code></pre> <p>The first line divides the <code>foo</code> variable with <code>2/g</code>. The second line calls the <code>foo</code> function with the regex literal <code>/= 2/g</code>. Again, since <code>jsTokens</code> only sees forwards, it cannot tell the two cases apart.</p> <p>There are some cases where we can tell division and regex literals apart, though.</p> <p>First off, we have the simple cases where there\u2019s only one slash in the line:</p> <pre><code>var foo = 2/g\nfoo /= 2\n</code></pre> <p>Regex literals cannot contain newlines, so the above cases are correctly identified as division. Things are only problematic when there are more than one non-comment slash in a single line.</p> <p>Secondly, not every character is a valid regex flag.</p> <pre><code>var number = bar / 2/e\n</code></pre> <p>The above example is also correctly identified as division, because <code>e</code> is not a valid regex flag. I initially wanted to future-proof by allowing <code>[a-zA-Z]*</code> (any letter) as flags, but it is not worth it since it increases the amount of ambigous cases. So only the standard <code>g</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>u</code> flags are allowed. This means that the above example will be identified as division as long as you don\u2019t rename the <code>e</code> variable to some permutation of <code>gmiyus</code> 1 to 6 characters long.</p> <p>Lastly, we can look forward for information.</p> <ul> <li>If the token following what looks like a regex literal is not valid after a   regex literal, but is valid in a division expression, then the regex literal   is treated as division instead. For example, a flagless regex cannot be   followed by a string, number or name, but all of those three can be the   denominator of a division.</li> <li>Generally, if what looks like a regex literal is followed by an operator, the   regex literal is treated as division instead. This is because regexes are   seldomly used with operators (such as <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>==</code>), but division   could likely be part of such an expression.</li> </ul> <p>Please consult the regex source and the test cases for precise information on when regex or division is matched (should you need to know).

Thus, a pattern like <code>+(a|{b),c)}</code>, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded first into the set of <code>+(a|b)</code> and <code>+(a|c)</code>, and those patterns are checked for validity. Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.</p> <p>Negated extglob patterns are handled as closely as possible to Bash semantics, but there are some cases with negative extglobs which are exceedingly difficult to express in a JavaScript regular expression. In particular the negated pattern <code>&lt;start&gt;!(&lt;pattern&gt;*|)*</code> will in bash match anything that does not start with <code>&lt;start&gt;&lt;pattern&gt;</code>. However, <code>&lt;start&gt;!(&lt;pattern&gt;*)*</code> will match paths starting with <code>&lt;start&gt;&lt;pattern&gt;</code>, because the empty string can match against the negated portion. In this library, <code>&lt;start&gt;!(&lt;pattern&gt;*|)*</code> will not match any pattern starting with <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>, due to a difference in precisely which patterns are considered \"greedy\" in Regular Expressions vs bash path expansion. This may be fixable, but not without incurring some complexity and performance costs, and the trade-off seems to not be worth pursuing.</p> <p>Note that <code>fnmatch(3)</code> in libc is an extremely naive string comparison matcher, which does not do anything special for slashes. This library is designed to be used in glob searching and file walkers, and so it does do special things with <code>/</code>. Thus, <code>foo*</code> will not match <code>foo/bar</code> in this library, even though it would in <code>fnmatch(3)</code>.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/minimatch/LICENSE/","title":"Blue Oak Model License","text":"<p>Version 1.0.0</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/minimatch/LICENSE/#purpose","title":"Purpose","text":"<p>This license gives everyone as much permission to work with this software as possible, while protecting contributors from liability.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/minimatch/LICENSE/#acceptance","title":"Acceptance","text":"<p>In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.

The philosophy behind MobX is simple:</p> \ud83d\ude19 Straightforward <p>Write minimalistic, boilerplate-free code that captures your intent.             Trying to update a record field? Simply use a normal JavaScript assignment \u2014             the reactivity system will detect all your changes and propagate them out to where they are being used.

This guarantees that computations that depend on your state, like React components, run only when strictly needed.                 There is no need to manually optimize components with error-prone and sub-optimal techniques like memoization and selectors.             </p> \ud83e\udd39\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Architectural freedom <p>                 MobX is unopinionated and allows you to manage your application state outside of any UI framework.

- In mobx5 all own properties were by default observable regardless of their value.

The production build strips most typechecks, resulting in a faster and smaller build. Make sure to substitute process.env.NODE_ENV = \"production\" in your build process! If you are using MobX in a react project, you most probably already have set this up. Otherwise, the idea is explained here.</li> <li>Introduced <code>flow</code> to create a chain of async actions. This is the same function as <code>asyncActions</code> of the mobx-utils package</li> <li>These <code>flow</code>'s are now cancellable, by calling <code>.cancel()</code> on the returned promise, which will throw a cancellation exception into the generator function.</li> <li><code>flow</code> also has experimental support for async iterators (<code>async * function</code>)</li> <li>Introduced <code>decorate(thing, decorators)</code> to decorate classes or object without needing decorator syntax.</li> <li>Introduced <code>onBecomeObserved</code> and <code>onBecomeUnobserved</code>. These API's enable hooking into the observability system and get notified about when an observable starts / stops becoming used. This is great to automaticaly fetch data from external resources, or stop doing so.</li> <li><code>computed</code> / <code>@computed</code> now accepts a <code>requiresReaction</code> option. If it set, the computed value will throw an exception if it is being read while not being tracked by some reaction.</li> <li>To make <code>requiresReaction</code> the default, use <code>mobx.configure({ computedRequiresReaction: true })</code></li> <li>Introduced <code>mobx.configure({ disableErrorBoundaries })</code>, for easier debugging of exceptoins. By NaridaL through #1262</li> <li><code>toJS</code> now accepts the options: <code>{ detectCycles?: boolean, exportMapsAsObjects?: boolean }</code>, both <code>true</code> by default</li> <li>Observable maps are now backed by real ES6 Maps. This means that any value can be used as key now, not just strings and numbers.</li> <li> <p>The flow typings have been updated. Since this is a manual effort, there can be mistakes, so feel free to PR!</p> </li> <li> <p><code>computed(fn, options?)</code> / <code>@computed(options) get fn()</code> now accept the following options:</p> <ul> <li><code>set: (value) =&gt; void</code> to set a custom setter on the computed property</li> <li><code>name: \"debug name\"</code></li> <li><code>equals: fn</code> the equality value to use for the computed to determine whether its output has changed.

Immediately fire the effect function after the first evaluation of <code>expr</code></li> <li><code>equals</code>.

This also means it is no longer possible to pass multiple bags of properties to <code>extendObservable</code>. ~~<code>extendObservable</code> can no longer be used to re-declare properties. Use <code>set</code> instead to update existing properties (or introduce new ones).~~ Update 13-01-2020: the latter limitation has been reverted in MobX 4.15.2 / 5.15.2</li> <li>Iterating maps now follows the spec, that is, <code>map.values()</code>, <code>map.entries()</code>, <code>map.keys()</code>, <code>map[@@iterator]()</code> and <code>array[@@iterator]()</code> no longer return an array, but an iterator.

Although e.g. startTransition basically works, MobX as is doesn't respect the Suspense model and will always reflect the latest state that is being rendered with, so tearing might occur. I think this is in theoretically addressable by using <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> and capturing the current values together with the dependency tree of every component instance. However that isn't included in this pull request 1) it would be a breaking change, whereas the current change is still compatible with React 16 and 17. 2) I want to collect use cases where the tearing leads to problems first to build a better problem understanding.

I hope that this module doesn't blaze anyone. But it does go very fast, in the cases it's optimized for, if used properly.</p> <p>PathScurry provides ample opportunities to get extremely good performance, as well as several options to trade performance for convenience.</p> <p>Benchmarks can be run by executing <code>npm run bench</code>.</p> <p>As is always the case, doing more means going slower, doing less means going faster, and there are trade offs between speed and memory usage.</p> <p>PathScurry makes heavy use of LRUCache to efficiently cache whatever it can, and <code>Path</code> objects remain in the graph for the lifetime of the walker, so repeated calls with a single PathScurry object will be extremely fast. However, adding items to a cold cache means \"doing more\", so in those cases, we pay a price. Nothing is free, but every effort has been made to reduce costs wherever possible.</p> <p>Also, note that a \"cache as long as possible\" approach means that changes to the filesystem may not be reflected in the results of repeated PathScurry operations.</p> <p>For resolving string paths, <code>PathScurry</code> ranges from 5-50 times faster than <code>path.resolve</code> on repeated resolutions, but around 100 to 1000 times slower on the first resolution. If your program is spending a lot of time resolving the same paths repeatedly (like, thousands or millions of times), then this can be beneficial. But both implementations are pretty fast, and speeding up an infrequent operation from 4\u00b5s to 400ns is not going to move the needle on your app's performance.</p> <p>For walking file system directory trees, a lot depends on how often a given PathScurry object will be used, and also on the walk method used.</p> <p>With default settings on a folder tree of 100,000 items, consisting of around a 10-to-1 ratio of normal files to directories, PathScurry performs comparably to @nodelib/fs.walk, which is the fastest and most reliable file system walker I could find. As far as I can tell, it's almost impossible to go much faster in a Node.js program, just based on how fast you can push syscalls out to the fs thread pool.</p> <p>On my machine, that is about 1000-1200 completed walks per second for async or stream walks, and around 500-600 walks per second synchronously.</p> <p>In the warm cache state, PathScurry's performance increases around 4x for async <code>for await</code> iteration, 10-15x faster for streams and synchronous <code>for of</code> iteration, and anywhere from 30x to 80x faster for the rest.</p> <pre><code># walk 100,000 fs entries, 10/1 file/dir ratio\n# operations / ms\n New PathScurry object  |  Reuse PathScurry object\n     stream:  1112.589  |  13974.917\nsync stream:   492.718  |  15028.343\n async walk:  1095.648  |  32706.395\n  sync walk:   527.632  |  46129.772\n async iter:  1288.821  |   5045.510\n  sync iter:   498.496  |  17920.746\n</code></pre> <p>A hand-rolled walk calling <code>entry.readdir()</code> and recursing through the entries can benefit even more from caching, with greater flexibility and without the overhead of streams or generators.</p> <p>The cold cache state is still limited by the costs of file system operations, but with a warm cache, the only bottleneck is CPU speed and VM optimizations. Of course, in that case, some care must be taken to ensure that you don't lose performance as a result of silly mistakes, like calling <code>readdir()</code> on entries that you know are not directories.</p> <pre><code># manual recursive iteration functions\n      cold cache  |  warm cache\nasync:  1164.901  |  17923.320\n   cb:  1101.127  |  40999.344\nzalgo:  1082.240  |  66689.936\n sync:   526.935  |  87097.591\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, the speed improves by around 10-20x in the async case, 40x in the case of using <code>entry.readdirCB</code> with protections against synchronous callbacks, and 50-100x with callback deferrals disabled, and several hundred times faster for synchronous iteration.</p> <p>If you can think of a case that is not covered in these benchmarks, or an implementation that performs significantly better than PathScurry, please let me know.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/path-scurry/#usage","title":"USAGE","text":"<pre><code>// hybrid module, load with either method\nimport { PathScurry, Path } from 'path-scurry'\n// or:\nconst { PathScurry, Path } = require('path-scurry')\n\n// very simple example, say we want to find and\n// delete all the .DS_Store files in a given path\n// note that the API is very similar to just a\n// naive walk with fs.readdir()\nimport { unlink } from 'fs/promises'\n\n// easy way, iterate over the directory and do the thing\nconst pw = new PathScurry(process.cwd())\nfor await (const entry of pw) {\n  if (entry.isFile() &amp;&amp; entry.name === '.DS_Store') {\n    unlink(entry.fullpath())\n  }\n}\n\n// here it is as a manual recursive method\nconst walk = async (entry: Path) =&gt; {\n  const promises: Promise&lt;any&gt; = []\n  // readdir doesn't throw on non-directories, it just doesn't\n  // return any entries, to save stack trace costs.\n  // Items are returned in arbitrary unsorted order\n  for (const child of await pw.readdir(entry)) {\n    // each child is a Path object\n    if (child.name === '.DS_Store' &amp;&amp; child.isFile()) {\n      // could also do pw.resolve(entry, child.name),\n      // just like fs.readdir walking, but .fullpath is\n      // a *slightly* more efficient shorthand.\n      promises.push(unlink(child.fullpath()))\n    } else if (child.isDirectory()) {\n      promises.push(walk(child))\n    }\n  }\n  return Promise.all(promises)\n}\n\nwalk(pw.cwd).then(() =&gt; {\n  console.log('all .DS_Store files removed')\n})\n\nconst pw2 = new PathScurry('/a/b/c') // pw2.cwd is the Path for /a/b/c\nconst relativeDir = pw2.cwd.resolve('../x') // Path entry for '/a/b/x'\nconst relative2 = pw2.cwd.resolve('/a/b/d/../x') // same path, same entry\nassert.equal(relativeDir, relative2)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/path-scurry/#api","title":"API","text":"<p>Full TypeDoc API</p> <p>There are platform-specific classes exported, but for the most part, the default <code>PathScurry</code> and <code>Path</code> exports are what you most likely need, unless you are testing behavior for other platforms.</p> <p>Intended public API is documented here, but the full documentation does include internal types, which should not be accessed directly.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/path-scurry/#interface-pathscurryopts","title":"Interface <code>PathScurryOpts</code>","text":"<p>The type of the <code>options</code> argument passed to the <code>PathScurry</code> constructor.</p> <ul> <li><code>nocase</code>: Boolean indicating that file names should be compared   case-insensitively.

This will be announced on our Discussion page and mentioned in the roadmap discussion.</p> Prism v1 contributing notes  Prism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, consider giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:  - Read the [documentation](https://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism was designed to be extensible. - Do not edit `prism.js`, it\u2019s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the `components/` folder. `prism.js` and all minified files are generated by our build system (see below). - Use `npm ci` to install Prism's dependencies. Do not use `npm install` because it will cause non-deterministic builds. - The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify the files and build `prism.js`. With all of Prism's dependencies installed, you just need to run the command `npm run build`. - Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/). Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc. - Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than a few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes that I want to merge and also changes that I don't, handling it becomes difficult. - My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review bigger PRs (small ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected. - If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition. - If you [add a new language definition](https://prismjs.com/extending.html#creating-a-new-language-definition) or plugin, you need to add it to `components.json` as well and rebuild Prism by running `npm run build`, so that it becomes available to the download build page. For new languages, please also add a few [tests](https://prismjs.com/test-suite.html) and an example in the `examples/` folder. - Go to [prism-themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) if you want to add a new theme.

Please use with caution, and be mindful of the caveat about Windows paths.</p> <p>For legacy reasons, this is also set if <code>options.allowWindowsEscape</code> is set to the exact value <code>false</code>.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/redoc/node_modules/minimatch/#comparisons-to-other-fnmatchglob-implementations","title":"Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations","text":"<p>While strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile goal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other implementations, and are intentional.</p> <p>If the pattern starts with a <code>!</code> character, then it is negated.  Set the <code>nonegate</code> flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading <code>!</code> characters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the pattern with a negative extglob pattern like <code>!(a|B)</code>.  Multiple <code>!</code> characters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple times.</p> <p>If a pattern starts with <code>#</code>, then it is treated as a comment, and will not match anything.  Use <code>\\#</code> to match a literal <code>#</code> at the start of a line, or set the <code>nocomment</code> flag to suppress this behavior.</p> <p>The double-star character <code>**</code> is supported by default, unless the <code>noglobstar</code> flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob and bash 4.1, where <code>**</code> only has special significance if it is the only thing in a path part.  That is, <code>a/**/b</code> will match <code>a/x/y/b</code>, but <code>a/**b</code> will not.</p> <p>If an escaped pattern has no matches, and the <code>nonull</code> flag is set, then minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than interpreting the character escapes.  For example, <code>minimatch.match([], \"\\\\*a\\\\?\")</code> will return <code>\"\\\\*a\\\\?\"</code> rather than <code>\"*a?\"</code>.  This is akin to setting the <code>nullglob</code> option in bash, except that it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.</p> <p>If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any other interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like <code>+(a|{b),c)}</code>, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded first into the set of <code>+(a|b)</code> and <code>+(a|c)</code>, and those patterns are checked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.</p> <p>Note that <code>fnmatch(3)</code> in libc is an extremely naive string comparison matcher, which does not do anything special for slashes.  This library is designed to be used in glob searching and file walkers, and so it does do special things with <code>/</code>.  Thus, <code>foo*</code> will not match <code>foo/bar</code> in this library, even though it would in <code>fnmatch(3)</code>.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/reftools/","title":"RefTools","text":""},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/reftools/#functions","title":"Functions","text":"nop(obj)

Somewhere else you see a similar 'anarchy' of codes is in the x86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of \"interrupts\" that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of which have been phased out.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/strip-ansi-cjs/node_modules/ansi-regex/readme/#maintainers","title":"Maintainers","text":"<ul> <li>Sindre Sorhus</li> <li>Josh Junon</li> </ul> Get professional support for this package with a Tidelift subscription <sub>         Tidelift helps make open source sustainable for maintainers while giving companiesassurances about security, maintenance, and licensing for their dependencies.     </sub>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/strnum/","title":"strnum","text":"<p>Parse string into Number based on configuration</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/strnum/#users","title":"Users","text":"<p>  Many React Native projects and plugins</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/strnum/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p><pre><code>npm install strnum\n</code></pre> <pre><code>const toNumber = require(\"strnum\");\n\ntoNumber(undefined) // undefined\ntoNumber(null)) //null\ntoNumber(\"\")) // \"\"\ntoNumber(\"string\"); //\"string\")\ntoNumber(\"12,12\"); //\"12,12\")\ntoNumber(\"12 12\"); //\"12 12\")\ntoNumber(\"12-12\"); //\"12-12\")\ntoNumber(\"12.12.12\"); //\"12.12.12\")\ntoNumber(\"0x2f\"); //47)\ntoNumber(\"-0x2f\"); //-47)\ntoNumber(\"0x2f\", { hex :  true}); //47)\ntoNumber(\"-0x2f\", { hex :  true}); //-47)\ntoNumber(\"0x2f\", { hex :  false}); //\"0x2f\")\ntoNumber(\"-0x2f\", { hex :  false}); //\"-0x2f\")\ntoNumber(\"06\"); //6)\ntoNumber(\"06\", { leadingZeros :  true}); //6)\ntoNumber(\"06\", { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"06\")\n\ntoNumber(\"006\"); //6)\ntoNumber(\"006\", { leadingZeros :  true}); //6)\ntoNumber(\"006\", { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"006\")\ntoNumber(\"0.0\"); //0)\ntoNumber(\"00.00\"); //0)\ntoNumber(\"0.06\"); //0.06)\ntoNumber(\"00.6\"); //0.6)\ntoNumber(\".006\"); //0.006)\ntoNumber(\"6.0\"); //6)\ntoNumber(\"06.0\"); //6)\n\ntoNumber(\"0.0\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //0)\ntoNumber(\"00.00\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"00.00\")\ntoNumber(\"0.06\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //0.06)\ntoNumber(\"00.6\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"00.6\")\ntoNumber(\".006\", { leadingZeros :  false}); //0.006)\ntoNumber(\"6.0\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //6)\ntoNumber(\"06.0\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"06.0\")\ntoNumber(\"-06\"); //-6)\ntoNumber(\"-06\", { leadingZeros :  true}); //-6)\ntoNumber(\"-06\", { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"-06\")\n\ntoNumber(\"-0.0\"); //-0)\ntoNumber(\"-00.00\"); //-0)\ntoNumber(\"-0.06\"); //-0.06)\ntoNumber(\"-00.6\"); //-0.6)\ntoNumber(\"-.006\"); //-0.006)\ntoNumber(\"-6.0\"); //-6)\ntoNumber(\"-06.0\"); //-6)\n\ntoNumber(\"-0.0\"   ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //-0)\ntoNumber(\"-00.00\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"-00.00\")\ntoNumber(\"-0.06\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //-0.06)\ntoNumber(\"-00.6\",  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"-00.6\")\ntoNumber(\"-.006\",  {leadingZeros :  false}); //-0.006)\ntoNumber(\"-6.0\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //-6)\ntoNumber(\"-06.0\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"-06.0\")\ntoNumber(\"420926189200190257681175017717\")  ; //4.209261892001902e+29)\ntoNumber(\"000000000000000000000000017717\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"000000000000000000000000017717\")\ntoNumber(\"000000000000000000000000017717\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  true}); //17717)\ntoNumber(\"01.0e2\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"01.0e2\")\ntoNumber(\"-01.0e2\"  ,  { leadingZeros :  false}); //\"-01.0e2\")\ntoNumber(\"01.0e2\") ; //100)\ntoNumber(\"-01.0e2\") ; //-100)\ntoNumber(\"1.0e2\") ; //100)\n\ntoNumber(\"-1.0e2\") ; //-100)\ntoNumber(\"1.0e-2\"); //0.01)\n\ntoNumber(\"+1212121212\"); // 1212121212\ntoNumber(\"+1212121212\", { skipLike: /\\+[0-9]{10}/} )); //\"+1212121212\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Supported Options <pre><code>hex: true,          //when hexadecimal string should be parsed\nleadingZeros: true, //when number with leading zeros like 08 should be parsed. 0.0 is not impacted\neNotation: true,    //when number with eNotation or number parsed in eNotation should be considered\nskipLike: /regex/   //when string should not be parsed when it matches the specified regular expression\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/strnum/CHANGELOG/","title":"CHANGELOG","text":"<p>1.1.2 / 2025-02-27 - fix skiplike for 0</p> <p>1.1.1 / 2025-02-21 - All recent fixes of version 2</p> <p>2.0.4 / 2025-02-20 - remove console log</p> <p>2.0.3 / 2025-02-20 - fix for string which are falsly identified as e-notation</p> <p>2.0.1 / 2025-02-20 - fix: handle only zeros - fix: return original string when NaN</p> <p>2.0.0 / 2025-02-20 - Migrating to ESM modules.

This libary generates the `source` string to be passed to `new RegExp()` for matching a range of numbers.  **Example**  <pre><code>const toRegexRange = require('to-regex-range');\nconst regex = new RegExp(toRegexRange('15', '95'));\n</code></pre>  A string is returned so that you can do whatever you need with it before passing it to `new RegExp()` (like adding `^` or `$` boundaries, defining flags, or combining it another string).   Why use this library?   ### Convenience  Creating regular expressions for matching numbers gets deceptively complicated pretty fast.  For example, let's say you need a validation regex for matching part of a user-id, postal code, social security number, tax id, etc:  * regex for matching `1` =&gt; `/1/` (easy enough) * regex for matching `1` through `5` =&gt; `/[1-5]/` (not bad...) * regex for matching `1` or `5` =&gt; `/(1|5)/` (still easy...) * regex for matching `1` through `50` =&gt; `/([1-9]|[1-4][0-9]|50)/` (uh-oh...) * regex for matching `1` through `55` =&gt; `/([1-9]|[1-4][0-9]|5[0-5])/` (no prob, I can do this...) * regex for matching `1` through `555` =&gt; `/([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-4][0-9]{2}|5[0-4][0-9]|55[0-5])/` (maybe not...) * regex for matching `0001` through `5555` =&gt; `/(0{3}[1-9]|0{2}[1-9][0-9]|0[1-9][0-9]{2}|[1-4][0-9]{3}|5[0-4][0-9]{2}|55[0-4][0-9]|555[0-5])/` (okay, I get the point!)  The numbers are contrived, but they're also really basic. In the real world you might need to generate a regex on-the-fly for validation.  **Learn more**  If you're interested in learning more about [character classes](http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html) and other regex features, I personally have always found [regular-expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html) to be pretty useful.  ### Heavily tested  As of April 07, 2019, this library runs [&gt;1m test assertions](./test/test.js) against generated regex-ranges to provide brute-force verification that results are correct.  Tests run in ~280ms on my MacBook Pro, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7.  ### Optimized  Generated regular expressions are optimized:  * duplicate sequences and character classes are reduced using quantifiers * smart enough to use `?` conditionals when number(s) or range(s) can be positive or negative * uses fragment caching to avoid processing the same exact string more than once"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/to-regex-range/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>Add this library to your javascript application with the following line of code</p> <pre><code>const toRegexRange = require('to-regex-range');\n</code></pre> <p>The main export is a function that takes two integers: the <code>min</code> value and <code>max</code> value (formatted as strings or numbers).</p> <pre><code>const source = toRegexRange('15', '95');\n//=&gt; 1[5-9]|[2-8][0-9]|9[0-5]\n\nconst regex = new RegExp(`^${source}$`);\nconsole.log(regex.test('14')); //=&gt; false\nconsole.log(regex.test('50')); //=&gt; true\nconsole.log(regex.test('94')); //=&gt; true\nconsole.log(regex.test('96')); //=&gt; false\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/to-regex-range/#options","title":"Options","text":""},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/to-regex-range/#optionscapture","title":"options.capture","text":"<p>Type: <code>boolean</code></p> <p>Deafault: <code>undefined</code></p> <p>Wrap the returned value in parentheses when there is more than one regex condition.

Let's try to explain.</p> <p>WebIDL, as part of its madness-inducing design, has its own type system. When people write algorithms in web platform specs, they usually operate on WebIDL values, i.e. instances of WebIDL types. For example, if they were specifying the algorithm for our <code>doStuff</code> operation above, they would treat <code>x</code> as a WebIDL value of WebIDL type <code>boolean</code>. Crucially, they would not treat <code>x</code> as a JavaScript variable whose value is either the JavaScript <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. They're instead working in a different type system altogether, with its own rules.</p> <p>Separately from its type system, WebIDL defines a \"binding\" of the type system into JavaScript. This contains rules like: when you pass a JavaScript value to the JavaScript method that manifests a given WebIDL operation, how does that get converted into a WebIDL value? For example, a JavaScript <code>true</code> passed in the position of a WebIDL <code>boolean</code> argument becomes a WebIDL <code>true</code>. But, a JavaScript <code>true</code> passed in the position of a WebIDL <code>unsigned long</code> becomes a WebIDL <code>1</code>. And so on.</p> <p>Finally, we have the actual implementation code. This is usually C++, although these days some smart people are using Rust. The implementation, of course, has its own type system. So when they implement the WebIDL algorithms, they don't actually use WebIDL values, since those aren't \"real\" outside of specs. Instead, implementations apply the WebIDL binding rules in such a way as to convert incoming JavaScript values into C++ values. For example, if code in the browser called <code>doStuff(true, true)</code>, then the implementation code would eventually receive a C++ <code>bool</code> containing <code>true</code> and a C++ <code>uint32_t</code> containing <code>1</code>.</p> <p>The upside of all this is that implementations can abstract all the conversion logic away, letting WebIDL handle it, and focus on implementing the relevant methods in C++ with values of the correct type already provided. That is payoff of WebIDL, in a nutshell.</p> <p>And getting to that payoff is the goal of this project\u2014but for JavaScript implementations, instead of C++ ones. That is, this library is designed to make it easier for JavaScript developers to write functions that behave like a given WebIDL operation. So conceptually, the conversion pipeline, which in its general form is JavaScript values \u21a6 WebIDL values \u21a6 implementation-language values, in this case becomes JavaScript values \u21a6 WebIDL values \u21a6 JavaScript values. And that intermediate step is where all the logic is performed: a JavaScript <code>true</code> becomes a WebIDL <code>1</code> in an unsigned long context, which then becomes a JavaScript <code>1</code>.</p>"},{"location":"api_reference/reference/node_modules/webidl-conversions/#dont-use-this","title":"Don't Use This","text":"<p>Seriously, why would you ever use this? You really shouldn't. WebIDL is \u2026 not great, and you shouldn't be emulating its semantics.

To do so, <code>IrisModuleInterface</code> offers us another method <code>register_to_hook</code> [ref], which we can call for each hook we want to subscribe.  </p> <p>Here is a summary of the events:   </p> <ol> <li>IRIS calls <code>register_hooks</code> of our module. This indicates it is time for us to register our hooks.  </li> <li>Within this method, we call <code>register_to_hook</code> for each hook we want to subscribe</li> </ol> <p>Let's add this to our main class and register to the <code>on_postload_ioc_create</code>. This will notify use each time a new IOC is created and committed to the database. </p> iris_dummy_module/IrisDummyModule.py<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n# Import the IrisInterface class\nfrom iris_interface.IrisModuleInterface import IrisModuleInterface\n\n\n# Create our module class\nclass IrisDummyModule(IrisModuleInterface):\n    # Set the configuration\n    _module_name = interface_conf.module_name\n    _module_description = interface_conf.module_description\n    _interface_version = interface_conf.interface_version\n    _module_version = interface_conf.module_version\n    _pipeline_support = interface_conf.pipeline_support\n    _pipeline_info = interface_conf.pipeline_info\n    _module_configuration = interface_conf.module_configuration\n    _module_type = interface_conf.module_type\n\n    def register_hooks(self, module_id: int):\n        \"\"\"\n        Called by IRIS indicating it's time to register hooks.  \n\n        :param module_id: Module ID provided by IRIS.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Call the hook registration method.

Our module has now officially subscribed to a hook and will be notified each time an IOC is created.  </p> <p>So how the module is notified? Once again this is done by a method named <code>hooks_handler</code> [ref] that <code>IrisModuleInterface</code> provides, and we need to overwrite.  </p> <p>This method is called each time one of the event associated to the hook we subscribed is triggered. It provides the name of the hook and as well as the data associated to it.  By overwriting this method, we can process the hook and the data! </p> <p>We will add a condition in this method, that is if the administrator sets the module parameter <code>log_received_hook</code> to False, then the module won't log anything and simply return the data.    </p> <p>Hint</p> <pre><code>The current configuration of the module can be accessed with the attribute ``self._dict_conf``.\n</code></pre> iris_dummy_module/IrisDummyModule.py<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n# Import the IrisInterface class\nfrom iris_interface.IrisModuleInterface import IrisModuleInterface\n\n\n# Create our module class\nclass IrisDummyModule(IrisModuleInterface):\n    # Set the configuration\n    _module_name = interface_conf.module_name\n    _module_description = interface_conf.module_description\n    _interface_version = interface_conf.interface_version\n    _module_version = interface_conf.module_version\n    _pipeline_support = interface_conf.pipeline_support\n    _pipeline_info = interface_conf.pipeline_info\n    _module_configuration = interface_conf.module_configuration\n    _module_type = interface_conf.module_type\n\n    def register_hooks(self, module_id: int):\n        \"\"\"\n        Called by IRIS indicating it's time to register hooks.  \n\n        :param module_id: Module ID provided by IRIS.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Call the hook registration method.
