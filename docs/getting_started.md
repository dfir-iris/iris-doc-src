# Quick Start

Dive into the most straightforward and recommended way to use IRIS with Docker, detailed below. 

## Pre-requisites

### Hardware üíª

IRIS is designed to be lightweight yet scalable, running smoothly on small laptops or powering large organizations. For a typical instance of 10 users, daily usage of ~200 alerts, and a few ongoing cases: 

- CPU : 8 cores
- RAM : 32 GB
- Storage : 1 TB fast SSD
     
Keep in mind that the database can grow rapidly, and modules may require more resources depending on their specific purposes. 

### Docker üê≥
IRIS requires Docker and Docker Compose for building and running the project. For installation instructions visit the official [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) website.   

The platform is officially supported on most Linux and MacOS systems. While it should work on Windows, some changes may be necessary to the dockerfiles for file storage paths. 

## Versioning üìà
Production-ready code is always tagged with a specific version number. Alpha and beta versions are not production-ready, so please avoid using the master branch for live environments.  


## Run IRIS üèóÔ∏è

To run IRIS, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `iris-web` repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-web.git
    cd iris-web
    ```

2. Check out the latest **non-beta** tagged version: 

    ```bash
    git checkout v2.4.20
    ```

3. Copy the environment file 

    ```
    cp .env.model .env
    ```

    !!! warning "Warning"
        The default configuration is suitable for testing only. To configure IRIS for production, see the [configuration section](operations/configuration.md). 

4. Pull the Docker containers:

    ```
    docker compose pull
    ```

5. Start IRIS:

    ```bash
    # Add "-d" to put it in the background
    docker compose up
    ```

IRIS should now be accessible on your host interface via HTTPS protocol, port 443 by default. You can access it through your web browser using `https://hostip`. 

Upon first start, an administrator account will be created. The password is printed in the console output and can be found by searching for `WARNING :: post_init :: create_safe_admin` in the logs. Alternatively, you can define an admin password at the first start using the `IRIS_ADM_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `.env`. **Please note that this setting has no effect once the administrator account is created.**

!!! info   
    If you don't find the password in the logs, try running `docker compose logs app | grep "WARNING :: post_init :: create_safe_admin"`. If the logs indicate that user administrator is already created, it means the instance already started once and the password has already been set. Check the [recovery options](/docs/operations/access_control/authentication.md). 

IRIS should now be available on the host interface, port 443, using HTTPS protocol by default. You can access it by navigating to https://hostip in your web browser.   

## Additional configuration üõ†Ô∏è

Please see [configuration](operations/configuration.md) for more details.

### Kubernetes

Enterprises wishing to run their IRIS instance on their preferred managed Kubernetes platform can utilize the official Helm charts and/or Kustomize manifests for enhanced deployment and management, ensuring high availability and seamless scaling as demand fluctuates. 

The deploy directory in the iris-web GitHub repository provides a starting point for deploying IRIS using EKS or GKE. Customize each variant with your values for a smooth deployment experience. 

For more details, please visit the [deploy directory on GitHub](https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-web/tree/master/deploy).  

## Components üì¶
Note that IRIS is split into five Docker services, each with a different role:

- `app` - iris_webapp: The core, including web server, database management, module management, etc.
- `db`: A PostgreSQL database
- `RabbitMQ`: A RabbitMQ engine to handle job queuing and processing
- `worker`: A job handler relying on RabbitMQ
- `nginx`: A NGINX reverse proxy

Each service can be built independently, which is useful when developing. In this QuickStart, all services are built at once.
