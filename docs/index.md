## What is IRIS?
IRIS is a collaborative digital platform designed for incident response analysts to share complex investigations at a technical level. It can be installed on a dedicated server or as a portable application for roaming investigations where internet access might not be available. 

Born from the need to easily and effectively communicate lengthy and intricate investigations among analysts, IRIS is an open-source project available on our [Github organization](https://github.com/dfir-iris).
